However, due to the specifics of processes and different batches of materials, mismatches in color and surface texture are possible. Such features are an integral part of the character of the concrete surface."

            "title": "Pores",
            "desc": "The process of pouring concrete mixture has its own peculiarities. Air remaining in the concrete is displaced during compaction and remains on the surface of the product in the form of caverns of various sizes. Such features always add decorativeness and naturalness to the concrete product. For surfaces in use, such as countertops, windowsills, inner bowls of washbasins, pores are rubbed down and according to our standard, the surface remains smooth."

        "colorVariation": {
            "title": "Surface Color Variation",
            "desc": "Concrete will never be monochromatic due to the use of various filters and the formation of the product structure with different densities. Due to this, a non-uniform surface with a unique pattern for each product is created. Denser areas are usually darker and the gradient may intensify when the product gets wet."

            "desc": "Some products require collapsible molds consisting of two or more parts. When stripping such forms, a looser and more non-uniform texture may appear on the surface at the seam, as moisture from the mixture at the seam may evaporate more intensively."

Similarly to natural stone or wood, concrete acquires a natural texture over time and evolves depending on the operating mode."
